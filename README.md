## ‚ùì How to use

Here's a basic example to work with it

```js
const { colors } = require("discordjs-colors-bundle");

if (command == "e?color-name") {
  const ColorsEmbed = new EmbedBuilder()
    .setTitle("Just an embed")
    .setDescription(
      "This embed is colored by [discordjs-colors-bundle](https://npmjs.com/package/discordjs-colors-bundle)"
    )
    .setColor(colors.MaximumBlueGreen); // Maximum Blue Green color

  message.reply({ embeds: [ColorsEmbed] });
}
```

You can also use the ENUM:

```js
const { Colors } = require("discordjs-colors-bundle");

if (command == "e?color-name") {
  const ColorsEmbed = new EmbedBuilder()
    .setTitle("Just an embed")
    .setDescription(
      "This embed is colored by [discordjs-colors-bundle](https://npmjs.com/package/discordjs-colors-bundle)"
    )
    .setColor(Colors.MaximumBlueGreen); // Maximum Blue Green color

  message.reply({ embeds: [ColorsEmbed] });
}
```

If you want to log all the colors (just in case) you can use the **`colorNames()`** function.

Here's an example of it:

```js
console.log(colorNames(colors)); // You have to provide the object.
```

NOTE: THIS FEATURE IS DEPRECATED USE `logColorsNames()` INSTEAD.

```js
logColorsNames("Italic", colors); // Param1: Styling. Available: Bold, Italic, Regular, Bold Italic. param 2 and rest are for objects
```
